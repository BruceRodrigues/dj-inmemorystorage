Differences
===========

This library is based on `django-inmemorystorage <https://github.com/codysoyland/django-inmemorystorage>`_ by Cody Soyland,
with `modifications <https://github.com/SeanHayes/django-inmemorystorage>`_ made by Se√°n Hayes with support for the ``url`` method,
with `additional support <https://github.com/Vostopia/django-inmemorystorage>`_ for writing.

Wave's modifications include packaging, and test modifications such that ``python setup.py test`` works. This version
also bumps the version to ``1.0.0`` and renames it to dj-inmemorystorage such that it doesn't conflict on PyPI.
